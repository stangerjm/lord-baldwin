    `Lord Baldwin (Chester L. Baldwin II, born 13 January 1950, in Portland, Oregon), is a
    singer-songwriter, keyboardist and guitarist. Emerging from the 60s rock era, he developed
    a distinctive and rather eclectic style that blended folk, rock and jazz. He has recorded
    more than 50 albums as well as being the author of two novels, Stepping Between The Ants,
    and Heads, or Tales From The Summer Of Love.`,

    `Between his mother, Eva R. Scarbrough and his father, Chester (Jack) Baldwin, who were
    both married multiple times, he has seven brothers and three sisters. His parents divorced
    when he was four and he went with his mother and her new husband. Coming from an unsettled
    upbringing, (his mother’s marriage to a bad guy, 1954 to 1967), Lord Baldwin moved around
    a lot, having lived in Oregon, California, Michigan, Alaska, New Jersey, New York, and
    Washington State.`,

    `Music has always been a central part of Lord Baldwin’s life and from an early age he found
    comfort and solace from his troubled childhood. From the age of ten, he was never without
    a harmonica. After seeing the Beatles in, ‘A Hard Day’s Night,’ in 1964, he began his
    lifelong quest to be a songwriter/musician/performer. He realized his writing potential
    in 1967 when an English Teacher, Miss Ulrich from Glendora High School, encouraged him to
    enter some of his lyrics (poems) in a collection of published works. He moved to New Jersey
    in the fall of that year and never found out if any of his works had been accepted, but with
    his confidence strengthened, he continued to write lyrics for songs throughout high school.`,

    `Lord Baldwin has always been drawn to the magnificence and magic of the piano, and throughout
     his childhood, whenever the opportunity presented itself, he would immerse himself into
     playing and learning more about the instrument. During recesses and lunch breaks at school,
     instead of spending time on the playgrounds or in the cafeterias, he could be found composing
     new material or playing and singing new lyrics to some new song he’d written.`,

    `In 1971, while working at Burger Chef, a local fast food restaurant a block from Portland State
    University, he met (and in 1973, later married), his lifelong sweetheart, Diane F. Weeks. In 1974,
    not long after their first-born child, Loren was born, they moved from Portland to Kelso Washington
    and soon transferred to Olympia Washington.`,

    `Lord Baldwin came to distinction locally in the Pacific Northwest, in Portland, the Seattle area
    and particularly in Olympia Washington where he has lived most of his adult life. He began writing
    songs and composing music in the early sixties in Los Angeles. In 1965, he won a school talent show
    singing a Manfred Mann song, ‘Do Wah Diddy Diddy,’ and a Herman’s Hermit song, ‘Mrs. Brown You’ve
    Got A Lovely Daughter.’ During the summer of 1965 Lord Baldwin was lead singer and blues harmonica
    player to a garage band called, ‘Seasonings.’ Unfortunately, the rest of the group was most
    comfortable doing ‘covers’ of other groups, specifically ‘The Stones’ (being fixated on
    ‘Satisfaction’), and didn’t want to experiment with a new sound, and so, after a short period of
    time, the group let him go.`,

    `In 1968, he worked in the Concord Hotel in the Catskills as a busboy. When not in the dining room,
    he would roam the hotel and play on the many pianos sprinkled about the resort hotel. It was during
    one of these times when he was approached by one of Raymond Parker’s sons and offered a staff job as
    piano player and social guide to the guests.`,

    `At the age of twenty, he bought his first guitar, a Yamaha acoustic 12 string, which was stolen
    from him three months later. Unfortunately, he had little money to replace the instrument and
    it was almost a year later before he could afford to purchase another guitar; a 1963 Fender
    acoustic. It was with this guitar that Lord Baldwin learned how to play, and of which he composed
    a healthy library of songs.`,

    `While Lord Baldwin struggled (in vain) to work his way up in his new occupation as a driver of
    goods for an electronics wholesale firm, he continued to write songs while he settled in to become
    a family man. His family continued to grow and after Loren Frances was born in 1973, Chester III
    was born in 1975, Elizabeth Victoria in 1977, Meridith Anne in 1979, Benjamin Hezekiah, in 1981,
    Stephen Andrew, in 1983, Spencer John, in 1986, Christopher Michael in 1988, Allison Jane in 1990
    and Brian Theodore in 1994.`,

    `For a lot of reasons, Lord Baldwin’s inspiration and creativity seemed to lose the momentum
    between the late seventies and the early eighties. He attributed this dry spell to a combination
    of low self-esteem brought on by not meeting up to the expectations of the man, along with a lack
    of self-confidence, in himself as well as his works, and the disappointment with not knowing how
    to, or being able to, market himself to do something with his music on a wider scale.`,

    `Lord Baldwin had a renaissance and or, a revitalization to his songwriting and performing in 1983,
     not long after he started working for the Forest Funeral Home. It was there that, after working
     as a funeral director and embalmer, he reevaluated himself, his priorities in life, ultimately
     realizing the blessings and strengths of his family and friends. It was then that his own special
     style began to surface. He started to see himself and his original but eclectic material from a
     different perspective, and he viewed his material with a new sense of value.`,

  [
    `Songs began to flow out, even in his dreams, and he was wise enough to take the time and document
    the tunes and words while they were fresh in his mind. In 1991, after typing the bulk of the
    lyrics of his continually expanding work, Lord Baldwin purchased a 4-track, Tascam Cassette
    Recorder, and immediately began recording his material. Not long after, taking what he believed to
    be the best of his then material, he recorded his first two albums, ‘Lonely Too Long,’ and ‘A
    Working Man.’ Because he was dealing with 90-minute cassettes, he engineered these albums to be 45
    minutes each, so as to fill both sides of a 90-minute cassette. This was a practice that he
    continued to follow all the way up to his forty-first and forty-second albums, and thereafter he
    used a mixed combination of analog to digital technology.`,

    `These first two albums were very well received and were followed by the third and fourth albums,
    ‘Forever Friends,’ and, ‘Something Must Be Wrong.’ To Lord Baldwin, these two albums are considered
    to be his least favorite works, perhaps because when constructing the first two albums, he had a
    cache of recordings, of which he took out the best material for those albums. He then took the other
    songs; songs that he later labeled as, ‘B’ songs, and with a few added newly recorded good songs, he
    constructed the third and fourth albums. Lord Baldwin realized it was a mistake to use already
    unwanted songs or to be precise, renditions of his songs that did not meet his standards; an error he
    did not repeat, except for the 28th and 29th albums, for where there were more new, ‘A’ than ‘B’
    material songs, and of which, he also felt that some of the ‘B’ songs were marginally classified.`,

    `Lord Baldwin borrowed a keyboard from Diane’s Cousin Martha where he was able to add a percussion
    of sorts, along with keyboard and organ music to grace his songs. The Keyboard was cheap and had a
    funky, plastic sound to it, but he nevertheless used it to its capacity and embellished six albums
    with its sounds before Cousin Martha asked for it back.`,

    `In May of 1992, Lord Baldwin lost his three-year-old son, Christopher Michael, which sent him into
    a long period of mourning. Perhaps more than anything else, Lord Baldwin’s music brought him comfort
    and relief from his anguish. After a Yamaha keyboard was sent anonymously to his house, he began to
    record again. This new keyboard had a stronger, realer piano sound along with other percussion
    settings that allowed him expand the scope of his work and embellish his recordings with a truer
    sound. ‘Spinning My Wheels,’ his ninth album, and, ‘Heaven,’ his tenth album, were the first albums
    to reflect this new sound.`,

    `In September of 1992, while driving his daughter Lori, (along with the rest of the family), up to
    Western Washington University, they listened strictly to country and western stations during the
    three hour drive to get up there. It was while driving that Lord Baldwin compiled the words to the
    song, ‘You’ve Got To Believe,’ and on the way back home, decided to record a country and western
    album. As per his methodology of the past, using a combination of newly written and already written
    but newly arranged songs, he recorded albums eleven and twelve; ‘A Long Way From My Home,’ and
    ‘You’ve Got To Believe.’ Although Lord Baldwin was limited to the four tracks and was not able to
    record exactly what he’d imagined, much of the material reflects the spirit of his lyrical and
    musical vision.`,

    `In 1993, Lord Baldwin recorded another ten albums, working off of more newly written material, and
    prolifically writing songs and lyrics. While writing and recording songs, many musical ideas came
    to Lord Baldwin that he recorded to maybe find words for at a later time. He recorded six albums of
    these musical pieces, a few of which were later converted with lyrics. More material came to him and
    by 1994 more than half of each album was graced with new songs.`,

    `In 1994 he began writing short stories about his life and times as a young Boy Scout in 1963. When
    his mother passed away in 1996, his motivation diminished and he shelved the stories and went back
    to songwriting full time. In early 2001, Lord Baldwin returned to writing, but this time he began
    working on a novel, compiling the stories from his past as chapters. He continued to slowly work on
    this book, called Stepping Between The Ants, spending an hour each day to write. Almost two years
    later not quite done with the book, he let some of his family and friends read the stories, but after
    getting negative responses he tabled the project.`,

    `In late 2002, he started working on a new book, this one called. Heads, or Tales from the Summer Of
    Love. This story chiefly documents the life of a 17-year-old boy named Reuben, a teenager in the late
    sixties living in Los Angeles, that, through a comedy of errors, finds himself living out on the
    streets during the summer of 1967. This story also follows the lives of six other characters as well
    as Reuben’s family. This book took about four years to write and another half a year to edit.`,

    `After getting much more favorable reviews on Heads, or Tales from the Summer Of Love, Lord Baldwin
    was encouraged to go back and rewrite the first book, Stepping Between The Ants. The rewrite took
    another two years and eventually was available in the summer of 2011. After he finished that project,
    Lord Baldwin went back to recording, and continues to write songs to the present day.`,
